* I'm Darya Vanichkina, a Genomics Data Scientist. I use data to make sense of the world, and teach others to do the same.

* I work as a postdoc at the [Gene and Stem Cell Therapy Program](http://www.centenary.org.au/cen_program/gene-stem-cell-therapy/) of the Centenary Institute in Sydney, where I investigate how the mammalian genome works using next-generation sequencing. I hold a PhD in Genomics and Bioinformatics, and a Specialist Degree in Molecular Biology.

* I'm proud to be a [Software and Data Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/) Instructor, Maintainer, Curriculum Contributor, and Mentor, and am passionate about enabling reproducible research using open source tools.
